# Monitoring Kubernetes Phase 1

## Project Overview

This planning document outlines Phase 1 of the Kubernetes monitoring implementation project. The project focuses on establishing comprehensive monitoring coverage for all critical Kubernetes components and integrating alerts with our communication platform.

## Project Tasks

| Task | SubTasks | Estimate Hours | Goal | Status |
|------|----------|----------------|------|---------|
| Create monitoring for Nodes | CPU, Memory, Disk usage, Pressure, Network, Ready status | 4 | Monitor node health and resource utilization | Done |
| Create monitoring for Kubelet / Kube-Proxy / Containerd | Process health, errors, resource usage | 3 | Monitor system component health | Done |
| Create monitoring for Control Plane (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager) | Latency, error rate, leader election, request queue, etc. | 3 | Monitor control plane performance and availability | Done |
| Create monitoring for Etcd | Disk I/O, latency, compaction, DB size, quorum | 4 | Monitor etcd cluster health and performance | Done |
| Create monitoring for Pod & Container Lifecycle | Monitor CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKills, image pull errors | 3 | Monitor application workload health | Done |
| Integrate monitoring to Zulip | Configure alert routing and notification formatting | 3 | Enable real-time incident notifications | Done |

## Project Summary

**Total Estimated Hours:** 20 hours

**Progress Status:**
- âœ… Node monitoring - Comprehensive resource and health tracking
- âœ… System components - Kubelet, Kube-Proxy, Containerd monitoring
- âœ… Control plane - API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Etcd monitoring - Database performance and cluster health tracking
- âœ… Pod lifecycle - Container crash and resource monitoring
- âœ… Zulip integration - Real-time alert notifications

**Key Achievements:**
- Established baseline monitoring for Kubernetes infrastructure
- Implemented workload health monitoring with crash detection
- Successfully integrated alerts with Zulip for immediate notifications
- Created comprehensive control plane observability

**Impact:** Enhanced Kubernetes cluster observability, enabling proactive issue detection and faster incident response.

**Priority:** High - Critical infrastructure monitoring
