# Fix Memory Limit on OSD in Ceph Cluster

## Project Overview

This planning document outlines the project to fix memory limit issues on OSDs (Object Storage Daemons) in our Ceph cluster. The project follows a phased approach starting with POC in a replica environment before implementing in production.

## Project Tasks

| Phase | Task | SubTasks | Estimate Hours | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|------|---------|
| Phase 1: Environment Preparation | Create replica k8s cluster production in colo | - Create new VMs<br>- Install k0s, vcluster, rook ceph cluster, DB Citus<br>- Match configuration with production | 6 | POC before production implementation | Done |
| Phase 2: POC Implementation | Execute safe POC fix memory limit | - Test memory limit adjustments<br>- Monitor cluster stability<br>- Document findings | 4 | Validate fix approach safely | Done |
| Phase 3: Backup & Recovery | Prepare full backup mechanism for performance & production | - Setup backup procedures<br>- Test backup integrity<br>- Document backup process | - | Backup plan if issues occur in production | Done |
| Phase 3: Backup & Recovery | Prepare full restore mechanism for performance & production | - Setup restore procedures<br>- Test restore process<br>- Document restore steps | - | Recovery plan if issues occur in production | Done |
| Phase 4: Production Implementation | Implement fix memory limit osd ceph in production | - Apply memory limit configurations<br>- Monitor cluster health<br>- Verify performance improvements | - | Resolve production memory issues | Done |

## Project Summary

**Total Estimated Hours:** 10+ hours

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Successfully created replica environment for safe testing
- ✅ Validated memory limit fix approach through POC
- ✅ Established comprehensive backup and restore procedures
- ✅ Successfully implemented fix in production environment

**Impact:** Resolved Ceph OSD memory limit issues, improving cluster stability and performance.

**Priority:** High - Critical infrastructure improvement

## Lessons Learned

1. **POC Approach:** Testing in replica environment prevented production risks
2. **Backup Strategy:** Having comprehensive backup/restore procedures provided confidence for production changes
3. **Phased Implementation:** Step-by-step approach ensured successful deployment
